  <h2>Hobbies</h2>

<ul>
  <li>What do you like to do? What are your hobbies?</li>
  What I like to do is music, play soccer, and as well write stories/poems. Music is one of my things because I like to do music and as well mess around with the beats. I never get tired of doing that. The other thing I like to do is play soccer. Soccer has always been one of the best sports that I like to play and I never get tired of it. Soccer is my passion and life. Last thing I like to do is write stories which I make up or even poems that can be about life or even love ones. These are the hobbies I like to do in my own time.
